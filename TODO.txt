# PRIORITY # 
Implement Community Extras into Community Survey 
Login/Logout system. 


# Somewhere # 
Begin writing documentation for Senate so that the db isn't destoryed as soon as it's launched (that would preferablly come much later when the entire website is depreciated and nobody learned how to update it.)

# IN community/models.py # 
Finish Community Surveys 

#IN community/survey_list.html 
Figure out what to do if comunitysurvey_list returns 0 

#IN community/survey_specific_result, community/views.py # 
Just fix this mess. 


#### WARNINGS #### 
Community Instance Image paths are a little wonky and have formatting done on them in the tempalte, watch out for that if 
it needs to be changed in release.
