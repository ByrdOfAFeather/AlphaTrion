# Next Weekend #
I'm imagining that our instant, non-email, communication has been setup; this is probably a good time to start planning a committees page.
Also, community committee is probably going to want to use the website very soon, and by that I mean the survey is going to need a professional overall. 
If the meeting to pass the website through the school does't happen by next week, then preparing for that is going to be of #### priority.

WHAT ARE COMMITTEES
Student COMMITTEES? - Is this just projects? Did I make COMMITTEES but wrong? No. Projects are always one-shot. 
Thanksgiving COMMITTEE makes more sense as a project instead of being part of spirit COMMITTEE (they are loosly connected).
Halloween makes more sense under spirit COMMITTEE. (does it though?)
Does Dance make more sense as a project? Possibly? I don't see its purpose as a COMMITTEE. It's not like there's much of a differnece, just that COMMITTEE have staying power. 
Park is obviously a project. 
Senate COMMITTEE? 
Comitie suggestion?
A page for every COMMITTEE? 
Definitly a COMMITTEE model. 
Do Commities need surveys? 
Should there be a survey to figure out what I need in COMMITTEES? Probably.
