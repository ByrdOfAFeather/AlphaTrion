___

## Purpose 

* Heal the School, Learn to Code 
	* However, I am by no means a profesional website developer at this point and this is one of my first maintained repos. Do not expect a 100% fullproof and profesionally maintained Repo, this is for learning. 
* Backend Technology 
	* This website is mostly built on django, however, for many of the graphs it is built of nodejs, bokeh, and vis.js
